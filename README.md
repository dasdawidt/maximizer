# Maximizer

> *Maximize anything! - Your screen is the limit.*

Get it on the [Chrome Web Store]()!

## Usage

1. Visit a website you like
2. Find some content of it that's worth maximizing
3. Right click the content to open the context menu
4. Press "Maximize something..."
5. Select the specific element you want to maximize
6. Enjoy the desired content in full width and height!

## Limitations

- Since the user visibly selects the element to maximize, only visible elements can be maximized.
This can lead too errors when content is wrapped inside a container that isn't visible.
In result, you may encounter situatios where it's a bit fiddly to select the exact element you want to maximize.
- When a website utilizes iframe elements, the selection is only available inside the iframe in which the context menu option of Maximizer has been triggered.
This originates in security limitations that browsers implement and cannot to my knowledge cannot be overcome.
- If a element is sÂ´clicked to be maximized, which the website itself responds to when clicked, the maximization can be interrupted

## Planned Features

- Control for background of maximized element
- Scrolling for maximized element

## Changelog

### 0.0.1
